steward
=======
To read this, you must be under FrienDA from Carl. If you are not under FrienDA, you should not be reading this.

This software is being actively developed and is not ready for release.
That will change soon.

My next step is to update the files in nodewiki so that the documentation reflects the current code base.

Your first step is to read the file nodewiki/00_Introduction.md

Enjoy!
