<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the client bootstrap page for the steward.
These instructions may seem a little cryptic.
Our goal is to securely bootstrap a client with the steward.
Once the bootstrap is successful,
the client and steward will automatically use industry-standard secure
technologies to communicate.
</p>

<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<ul>
<li>You need a smartphone running  <a href='https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447'>Google Authenticator</a>.</li>

<li>Scroll to the bottom of this page, fill-in the form, and press "Submit".</li>

<li>Launch the authenticator and scan the QR code.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Start with a home browser</h2>
<p>
First,
you should be using a browser on a computer on your home network.
Preferably,
the browser is running on the same computer as the steward.
</p>

<p>
If the browser is running on a different computer,
then there is a possibiity that a third device on your home network is
intercepting and modifying traffic between your browser and the
steward.
</p>

<p>
Speaking plainly:
most people don't think this is a likely possibility.
If that's the case for you, please skip down to the section
entitled <strong>Getting Started</strong>
</p>

<h2>If you wish to be "extra secure"</h2>
<p>
Congratulations: it is likely that you are conciencious, or paranoid, or both!
</p>

<p>
When the steward first comes up,
it creates a self-signed certificate for the client bootstrap process.
<em>If</em> there is a "man-in-the-middle" device on your network,
it <em>could</em> be surreptitiously capturing and modifying the
traffic between the browser and the steward.
</p>

<p>
When your browser first attempted to display this page,
you probably got a dialog that your browser couldn't "verify the identity of the website".
After clicking the "Details" button,
you probably clicked a box that says "Always trust 'steward' when connecting to ..." -- that's how you know that 
your browser is talking to a server (the steward) that is using a
self-signed certificate.
</p>

<p>
If you looked at the details for the certificate,
you would see a "SHA1 fingerprint" for the certificate, e.g.,
<blockquote>
9E DF 5F C4 17 E2 3E D3 88 E2 74 17 D6 93 91 8D 96 1D 9A E1
</blockquote>
That fingerprint is very important.
If someone is performing a man-in-the-middle attack,
you can compare the fingerprint known to the steward with the one seen
by the browser,
and they won't match!
</p>

<p>There are several ways to determine whether the browser and the steward are talking directly to each other:
<ul>
<li><em>if</em> the computer running the steward, and the computer running the browser are plugged into the same hub,
and nothing else is plugged into that hub; <em>or</em>,</li>

<li><em>if</em> the SHA1 fingerprint found on the steward in the file "sandbox/startup.sha1"
matches the SHA1 fingerprint reported by the browser</li>
</ul>
then no device <em>should</em> be able to capture/modify the traffic between the two.
</p>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
First,
you will need a smartphone
with <a href='https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447'>Google Authenticator</a>.
This is a program that will perform "token-based" authentication using
your Android, Blackberry or iOS device.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side: you don't have to remember a passphrase.
That's good, because it's over 40-characters long and changes every 30 seconds.
</p>

<p>
On the minus side: anyone with (unlocked) access to your phone will be able to access to the steward.
However, since smartphone's have become the repository of the digital life;
you are probably guarding (and locking) your smartphone zealously.
</p>

<p>
So,
if you haven't already downloaded Google Authenticator for your smartphone.
Please install it using these <a href='https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447'>instructions</a>.
</p>

<h2>Creating an Account</h2>
<p>
Here is a form that asks you to input a short name (e.g., "root")
and a longer, more descriptive name (e.g., "Angus MacPhail").
When you enter that information and click "Submit",
a "QR code" will appear that you scan with the Google Authenticator:
<ul>
<li>Launch the Authenticator application on your smartphone.</li>

<li>Press the "+" button and then the "Scan Barcode" button.</li>

<li>Point the smartphone's camera at the browser's screen,
center the QR code in the viewfinder,
and the application will automatically focus on the QR code and do the rest.</li>
</ul>
