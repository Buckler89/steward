#Magic

If you've read our [philosophy](01_Philosophy.md) document you'll know that what we're about is reducing friction for the user. Things should work like magic. The more buttons, switches, dials and other interface elements that stand between the user and their thing doing what they expect it to do, when they expect it to, makes the thing harder to use-it increases the friction between the user and their thing.

There is very little point automating your home if you end up with a home that's harder to use afterwards than it was before. If your lights are harder to use, or you have to think about what state they're in before flipping a wall switch you've not made your life simpler, you've made it just a little bit harder.

You don't want to have to think about that, you want it all to work like magic. That's our goal
