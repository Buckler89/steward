#Implementation


The implementation in this repository seperates the protocol from the model. The files:

    registration-server.js
    rendezvous-server.js

ipmlement the protocol, and the file:

    cloud-server.js

implements the security model.

This package is intended as a small-scale implementation, so all three files reside in a single process.
