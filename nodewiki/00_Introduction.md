The Thing System

#Installation and Getting Started

The first thing you'll need to do, whether you're a user or a developer is [install](User/00_Installation.md) and [start](User/02_Running.md) the _steward_ software.

#For Developers

There are three main tracks for developing for the Thing System

* Developing for the steward

* Developing third-party "things" which talk to the steward

* Developing client software, and magic
